# React Auth Demo
This is a demo on how to implement authentication and authorization in React using the following
- [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) - Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) -  Let's you use state and other React features without writing a class
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
